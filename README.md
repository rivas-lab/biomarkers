We characterized the genetics of 35 biomarkers in UK Biobank. We performed the association and fine-mapping analysis to prioritize the causal variants, constructed the polygenic risk score (PRS) models, and evaluated their medical relevance with causal inference and PRS-PheWAS. We demonstrate a new approach, called multi-PRS, to improve PRS by combining PRSs across traits.
